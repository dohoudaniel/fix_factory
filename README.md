# Fixing Deprecated APIs in Android
With each release, specific Android APIs may become obsolete or need to be refactored to provide a better developer experience or support new platform capabilities. In these cases, Android will officially deprecate the obsolete APIs and direct developers to new APIs to use instead.

Deprecation means that weâ€™ve ended official support for the APIs, but they will continue to remain available to developers. This page highlights some of the deprecations in this release of Android. To see other deprecations, refer to the API [diff report](https://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/31/changes).
